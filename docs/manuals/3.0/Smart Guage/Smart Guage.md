# Project 2.001: LED and Ultrasonic Sensor Control 

| **Description** | Double LED ON is a simple project that guides you in turning on two LEDs at the same time.  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | This project finds utility in basic signaling setups. For instance, it could be applied in an easier and basic lighting system, where two LEDs turning on together provide ample brightness when someone enters a room. |

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** type the following codes below.
```
// Include comments to explain the code
const int trigPin = 9;    // Trigger pin of ultrasonic sensor
const int echoPin = 10;   // Echo pin of ultrasonic sensor
const int redLed = 6;     // Pin connected to Red LED
const int greenLed = 7;   // Pin connected to Green LED

long duration;  // Variable to store duration of sound wave travel
int distance;   // Variable to store distance calculated

void setup() {
  // Set up the pins as input or output
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);

  // Start serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Clear the trigPin by setting it LOW
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);

  // Set the trigPin HIGH for 10 microseconds
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

  // Read the echoPin, and calculate the distance
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;  // Convert to distance in cm

  // Print the distance to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  // LED control based on distance
  if (distance < 10) {  // If object is within 10 cm
    digitalWrite(redLed, HIGH);  // Turn on Red LED
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW); // Turn off Green LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);   // Turn off Red LED
    digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH); // Turn on Green LED
  }

  // Delay to allow for stable readings
  delay(500);
}

```
