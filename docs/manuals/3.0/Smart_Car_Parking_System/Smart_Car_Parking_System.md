# Project 3.001: SMART CAR PARKING SYSTEM 

| **Description** | Double LED ON is a simple project that guides you in turning on two LEDs at the same time.  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | This project finds utility in basic signaling setups. For instance, it could be applied in an easier and basic lighting system, where two LEDs turning on together provide ample brightness when someone enters a room. |

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following code in your arduino IDE at the top of "void setup() { }" function as shown in the picture below.
   ```
   #include <Servo.h>
   // Pin Definitions
   const int trig  = 6;
   const int echo = 7;
   const int motor = 8;
   const int red = 9;
   const int green = 10;
   const int blue = 11;

   // Objects and Variables
   Servo barrierServo;
   long duration;
   int distance;
   bool parkingAvailable = true;
   ```

![Code 1](../../assets/3.0/Smart_car_parking_system/code_1.png)

**Step 3:** Type the following code inside of the "void setup() { }" function to initialize the pin modes

   ```
   // Pin Modes
   pinMode(trig, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(echo, INPUT);
   pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(blue, OUTPUT);

   // Initialize Servo
   barrierServo.attach(servoPin);
   barrierServo.write(90); // Barrier closed position

   Serial.begin(9600); // For debugging
   ```

![Code 2](../../assets/3.0/Smart_car_parking_system/code_2.png)

**Step 4:** Type the following code under "void loop() { }" function. This code is a function to calculate the distance of objects from the ultrasonic sensor.

   ```
   // Function to get distance from ultrasonic sensor
   int getDistance() {
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(2);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(10);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

      duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
      return duration * 0.034 / 2; // Convert to cm
   }
   ```

![Code 3](../../assets/3.0/Smart_car_parking_system/code_3.png)

**Step 5:** Type the following code under the new function. This code is a function to control the color of the RGB module to indicate parking availability.

   ```
   // Function to signal parking status
   void signalParkingStatus(bool available) {
      if (available) {
         // Green LED for available parking
         analogWrite(red, 0);
         analogWrite(green, 255);
         analogWrite(blue, 0);
      } else {
         // Red LED for occupied parking
         analogWrite(red, 255);
         analogWrite(green, 0);
         analogWrite(blue, 0);
      }
   }
   ```

![Code 4](../../assets/3.0/Smart_car_parking_system/code_4.png)

**Step 6:** Type the following code inside of the "void loop() { }" function.

   ```
   // Get distance from ultrasonic sensor
   distance = getDistance();

   if (parkingAvailable) {
      if (distance < 20 && distance > 0) { // Car detected
         parkingAvailable = false;
         signalParkingStatus(false);
         barrierServo.write(0); // Open barrier
         delay(5000); // Wait for the car to park
         barrierServo.write(90); // Close barrier
      } else {
         signalParkingStatus(true);
      }
   } else {
      signalParkingStatus(false);
   }

   delay(200); // Loop delay
   ```
