**Step 4:** Connect the black male-to-male jumper wire to (A0) on the sound sensor and the other end of the wire toA0 on the Arduino UNO.  As shown in the picture below:

![Picture5](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Connect the yellow male-to-male jumper wire to the positive (longer leg) of the Blue LED and the other end to the digital pin 8 on the Arduino board as shown below.

![Picture6](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture6.jpg)

**Step 6:** Using the brown male-to-male jumper wire, connect one end to the negative (shorter leg) of the blue LED and the other end to the “GND” on the Arduino, as shown below.

**Step 7:** Connect the purple male-to-male jumper wire to the positive (longer leg) of the green LED and the other end to the digital pin 9 on the Arduino board as shown below.

![Picture8](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture8.jpg)

**Step 8:** Using the green male-to-male jumper wire, connect one end of the wire to the negative (shorter leg) of the green LED and the other end to the “GND” on the Arduino as shown below.

![Picture9](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture9.jpg)

**Step 9:** Connect the red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive (longer leg) of the red LED and the other end to the digital pin 2 on the Arduino board as shown below. end to the “GND” on the Arduino, as shown below.

![Picture7](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture9.1.jpg)

**Step 10:** Using the white male-to-male jumper wire, connect one end of the wire to the shorter leg (positive) of the red LED and the other end to the “GND” on the breadboard as shown below.

![Picture8](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Picture9.2.jpg)

**Step 11:** Connect the black male-to-male jumper wire, to the GND connector on the breadboard and the other end to the GND port on the Arduino UNO board.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ``` const int SoundSensorPin = A0; 
            const int SoundSensorD0 = 6; 
            const int LED = 8;
            const int LED2 =9; 
            const int LED3 =2; ``` as shown in the picture below.

![Code1](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code1.png)

_**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket {} and semicolons; and place them as you see in the image. The code that comes after the two  backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them._

**Step 3:** In the { } after the void setup (),Type ```     pinMode(SoundSensorPin, INPUT);
        pinMode (soundSensorDO, INPUT);  
        pinMode (LED, OUTPUT); 
        pinMode (LED2, OUTPUT);
        pinMode (LED3, OUTPUT);
        Serial.begin (9600);  ``` as shown below in the image.

![Code2](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code2.png)

_The code above activates the serial monitor and LEDS._

**Step 4:** In the {} after the void loop (), Type ``` int SensorData = digitalRead(SoundSensorDO); 
int SoundValue = analogRead (SoundSensorPin); ``` as shown below in the image.

![Code3](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code3.png)

_NB:The above code reads data from the soundSensorPin._

**Step 5:** Type ``` if (soundValue > 100 ) {  } ; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Code4](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code4.png)


**Step 6:** Type ```   digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); 
                   digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH);
                   digitalWrite(LED3, HIGH)
                   Serial.println(SoundValue);
                    delay(200);
                    Serial.printIn(SoundValue) ``` as shown below in the image.

![Code5](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code5.png)

**Step 7:** And on the next line, Type ``` else {  } ; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Code6](../../assets/2.0/7.1.SoundSensor+3LEDs/Code6.png)

**Step 8:** Type 
    ``` digitalWrite (LED, LOW);
        digitalWrite (LED, LOW);
        digitalWrite (LED3, LOW); 
    ``` as shown below in the image.

## CONCLUSION
If you encounter any problems when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you did not encounter any problems and the program ran as expected, Congratulations on a job well done.
