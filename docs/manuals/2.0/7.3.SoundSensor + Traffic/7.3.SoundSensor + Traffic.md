## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ``` const int SoundSensorAPin = A0; const int SoundSensorDOPIN = 4; ``` as shown in the picture below.

_**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket {} and semicolons; and place them as you see in the image. The code that comes after the two  backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them._

**Step 3:** Type ``` const int redPin = 7; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic2](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic2.png)





**Step 4:** Type ``` const int yellowPin = 6; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic3](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic3.png)

**Step 5:** Type ``` const int greenPin = 7; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic4](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic4.png)

**Step 6:** In the { } after the void setup (),
Type ``` pinMode (redPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode (yellowPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode (greenPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode (soundSensorDOPin, INPUT); 
    ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic5](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic5.png)

**Step 7:** In the { } after the void setup (), Type ``` Serial.begin(9600); ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic6](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic6.png)

**Step 8:** In the {} after the void loop (), Type 
    ``` int soundValue = analogRead (SoundSensorAPin); 
        int digitalValue= digitalRead (SoundSensorDOPin); 
    ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic7](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic7.png)

- The above code reads data from the Soundsensor Pin.

**Step 9:** Type ``` Serial.print(“Sound Value:”);
	        Serial.printIn(soundValue);
                  ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic8](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic8.png)

**Step 10:** Type ``` if (soundValue > 100) {  } ; ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic9](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic9.png)

**Step 11:** Type  ``` digitalWrite (redPin, HIGH); 
           digitalWrite (yellowPin, LOW);
           digitalWrite (greenPin, LOW);
	       delay (500); 
                    ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic10](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic10.png)

**Step 12:** Type ``` digitalWrite (redPin, LOW); 
            digitalWrite (yellowPin, HIGH);
            digitalWrite (greenPin, LOW);
	         delay (500); 
                  ``` as shown below in the image.

![Programpic11](../../assets/2.0/7.3.SoundSensor%20+%20Traffic/Programpic11.png)

**Step 13:** Type ``` digitalWrite (yellowPin, LOW); 
           digitalWrite (greenPin, HIGH);
           digitalWrite (redPin, LOW);
	       delay (500); 
                  ``` as shown below in the image.

**Step 14:** Type ``` else {
             digitalWrite (BLUE_PIN, HIGH);
             digitalWrite (RED_PIN, LOW);
             digitalWrite (GREEN_PIN, LOW);  }
                 ``` as shown below in the image.

## CONCLUSION
If you encounter any problem when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you do not encounter any problem and the program runs as expected, Congratulations on a job well done.
