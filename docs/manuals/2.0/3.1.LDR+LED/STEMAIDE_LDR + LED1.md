## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

-	1 Arduino Uno 
-	1 Arduino USB cable 
-	1 Light dependent resistor   
-	1 Red LED 
-	1 Breadboard 
-	1 Red jumper wire 
-	1 Black jumper wire 
-	1 Green jumper wire 
-	1 White jumper wire

-	1 Blue male-to-male Jumper Wire 

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

### Things needed:

-	1 Red LED 
-	1 Breadboard 

**Step 1:** Take the light dependent resistor and the breadboard, insert the light dependent resistor into the horizontal connectors on the   breadboard.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

-	1 Red male-to-male jumper wire

-	1 White male-to-male jumper wire 
-	1 Brown male-to-male jumper wire 
-	1 Green male-to-male Jumper Wire 
-	1 Blue male-to-male Jumper Wire 

**Step 1:** Take the green jumper wire. Connect one end of the wire to the “VCC” port on the LDR module and the other end to the “5V” port on the Arduino UNO board. As shown in the picture below.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ```const int LDR_PIN = A0.```   as shown below in the image 
_**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket { }  and semicolons ;  and place them as you see in the image . The code that comes after the two ash backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them._

**Step 21:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 22:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 23:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## Conclusion

If you encounter any problems when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you did not encounter any problems and the program ran as expected Congratulations on a job well done.
