## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ``` const int LDR_PIN = A0.```   as shown below in the image 
_**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket { }  and semicolons ;  and place them as you see in the image . The code that comes after the two ash backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them._

![Code 1](../../assets/2.0/3.2.LDR+Buzzer/code_1.jpg).

**Step 3:** Type ```const int DO_PIN = 8;``` as shown below in the image

![Code 2](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED4/code_1.png).

**Step 4:** Type ```const int Red = 5;``` as shown below in the image

![Code 3](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED4/code_2.png).

**Step 5:** Type ```const int Green = 7;``` as shown below in the image

![Code 4](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED4/code_3.png).

**Step 8:** Type ```int ldrValue;  ``` as shown below in the image
![Code 2](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED4/code_6.png).

**Step 9:** Type ``` int digitalValue;  ``` as shown below in the image
![Code 3](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED2/code%206.PNG).

**Step 10:** Type the following code as shown below in the image
``` 
pinMode(DO_PIN, INPUT);
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(Red, OUTPUT);
pinMode(Green, OUTPUT);

```
![Code 4](../../assets/2.0/3.1.LDR+LED/LDR_and_LED2/code%204.PNG).

**Step 11:** NOW let finish up by tying the followi ng codes in the void loop function shown below in the image
``` 
ldrValue = analogRead(LDR_PIN);
  
  // Read the digital input value
  digitalValue = digitalRead(DO_PIN);

  // Print the LDR and digital values to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("LDR Value: ");
  Serial.print(ldrValue);
  Serial.print("  Digital Input: ");
  Serial.println(digitalValue);

  // Control the LEDs based on LDR value and digital input
  if (ldrValue < 500 && digitalValue == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(Red, HIGH);   // Turn on the Red LED
    digitalWrite(Green, LOW);  // Turn off the Green LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(Red, LOW);    // Turn off the Red LED
    digitalWrite(Green, HIGH); // Turn on the Green LED
  }

  // Small delay to stabilize readings
  delay(200);

```

**Step 21:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 22:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 23:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## Conclusion

If you encounter any problems when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you did not encounter any problems and the program ran as expected Congratulations on a job well done.
